# Login Mock Up

This is a mock login project built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). 

It lives at https://svelte-login-mock-up.now.sh/

There is a setTimeout on the inputs to detect when user has finished typing, field is then automatically checked for validation.

The input fields are also checked when user presses enter / tab or tries to naviagte away from the field.

If the check is failed the input field remains in focus.

Only when user has entered a valid email and password greater than 8 characters does the login button become active.

hardcoded login details to gain successful log in are

email : test+1234@example.net

Password : Test1234!
